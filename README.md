#WHY:

You're a clever dev. You know your way around all the new fanciest frameworks,
the coolest dev toys. Your terminal is styled just the way you like it. The one
thing you don't have? A social media presence. Well have I got the tool for you!

### USE:
`yarn global add im-doin` or `npm i -g im-doin`
Jam on the saxaphone by firing off a classy `im-doin` in your terminal window.
That will ask you for some creds. Those creds come from a firebase db, and some personal information.
More documentation about this process will be found on [the frontend](https://github.com/one19/im-doin-frontend)
Thereafter, you may invoke the update process by running `im-doin -m YOUR_MESSAGE -b BACKGROUND_STRING`
Also, firing off a solitary `im-doin` will open your website (: 

### Todo
* lots of readme
* more readme
* enough readme to make it **dead simple**
* add tests
* add coverage
* add ci testing/coverage/badges
